Welcome to our full-stack MERN project! This project is built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It is a complete end-to-end application that includes both the client-side and server-side code.


To run the project, first clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies like Node modules. It can be done using command "npm -i npx". Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the server using npm run start. This will start the server on http://localhost:5000.


To start the client-side, navigate to the client directory and run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies. Then, run npm start to start the client on http://localhost:3000.


This project includes several features such as user authentication, CRUD operations, and more. The server-side code is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provides a robust and flexible framework for building web applications. The database used is MongoDB, which is a popular NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility for our application.


The client-side code is built using React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project includes several React components, which can be easily customized and reused. The project also uses Redux for state management, which provides a predictable and centralized way to manage application state.


React Drop Zone is used for file upload and ReactRouter is used for Navigation.


The project includes user authentication, which allows users to sign up and log in to the application. This feature is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate users. The project also includes CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data. These operations are implemented using RESTful APIs, which provide a standardized way to interact with the server.


Overall, this project provides a comprehensive and customizable template for building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack. It includes several features and tools that can be easily customized and extended to meet your specific needs.
